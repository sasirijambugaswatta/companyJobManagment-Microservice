# Microservices Project

This project is a microservices-based application that consists of three main services: **Company**, **Job**, and **Review**. Users can create, update, delete, and retrieve these entities via the APIs exposed by these services.

## Overview

The project is built using several technologies and tools to ensure scalability, resilience, and easy management. Here are the key components and technologies used:

- **Spring Boot Actuator**: For monitoring and management of the application.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database to store entities.
- **pgAdmin**: To manage the PostgreSQL database.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application.
- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: To deploy and manage the application containers.
- **OpenFeign**: As a declarative web service client to simplify HTTP API calls.
- **Zipkin**: For distributed tracing to monitor and troubleshoot latency issues.
- **Spring Cloud Config Server**: For centralized configuration management.
- **API Gateway**: To manage and route the API requests.
- **Resilience4j**: For implementing fault tolerance.
- **RabbitMQ**: As a message broker. It is used in this project to calculate the average rating for each company by calling the Review microservice.
